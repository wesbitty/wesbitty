## Installation

```cli

```

## Usage

- Icon
  We use [Feather icon library](https://feathericons.com/) in **Wesbitty UI**

You can use any Icon from the library as a component by prepending `Icon` to any Icon name, like, `<IconHome>`

```js
import { IconHome } from 'ui'
//...
return <IconHome size="small" />
```

- Button
  To implement Button component into your project you'll need to add the import:

```js
import { Button } from 'ui'
```

After adding import into your project you can use it simply like:

```jsx
<Button type="primary">Button</Button>
```
