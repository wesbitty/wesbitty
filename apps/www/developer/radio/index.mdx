## When to use

- Used for selecting multiple selections from an array of options
- If using many options, it would make more sense to use a Select, or a Dropdown to facilitate the many options.

## Installing

Import the component

```js
import { Radio } from '@wesbitty/ui'
```

## Basic

Radios can be used alone. Pass the same `name` to them.

<CodeSample sample="RadioBasic" v="0" />

## Grouped checkboxes

Wrap the radio options in a Group, and use the Group to control and receive onChange.

Use the `<Radio.Group>` sub component to wrap `<Radio>` components together.

You can then set the `name` and use `onChange` for all the radios via the `<Radio.Group>` component.

<CodeSample sample="RadioGrouped" v="0" />

## Controlled checkbox

### ⚠️ This doesn't work at the moment

Requires value to be used in Radio.Group so that component can be controlled by React state.

! Also there is no DefaultValue

<CodeSample sample="RadioControlled" v="0" />

## Grouped radio with card styling

Using the prop `type` you can change the card styling to use `cards`.

<CodeSample sample="RadioGroupedCards" v="0" />
